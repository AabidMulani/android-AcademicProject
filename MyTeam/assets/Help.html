    <center><h3>HELP TOPICS</h3></center>

    <center><h4>Task Allocation</h4></center>
    In a scenario, where a team leader needs to allocate some work to his members, MyTeam provides an easy interface for this. It stores this allocated task on the central data server from where all others members get the knowledge of the work to be performed. A task can be a group task or a single task, which is allocated to multiple users individually. Basic attributes focused are the brief description, deadlines and task type. 
    <center><h4>Task Life-Cycle</h4></center>
    This consists of all the functional processing over the task allocated by the team leader. After the task is been allocated it should be updated with its progress report in a timely manner. In task life cycle interfaces are provided for commenting and status updating.
    <br>Every member has the authority to comment on the task which is allocated to him by the leader. This helps in easy communication and a record maintenance of the communication done on the given subject. These comments can be retrieved and response can be given by the team leader and the other members allocated to that task.
    <br>Status of the task has to be updated by the team member whenever any work has a progress. Each member will be representing the real time status of the given task; this status can be accessed by the leader from the central server. The leader can demand for a status update through the application which the member needs to respond.
    <center><h4>Performance Generation</h4></center>
    In the corporate world every decisions made by the official is done by considering the previous record and performance of that subject. Similarly a member can be analyzed using his past records and his performance can be generated. This performance is calculated on the count of his completed task within deadlines, scale of satisfactory performance in every individual task. This generated performance can then be used for making decision for that member. Decisions such as appraisals', promotions and even training allocations for members who are weak in specific fields.  
    <center><h4>Report Generation</h4></center>
    A report generation mechanism is provided by MyTeam. In this part, a report of the selected or all the activities of the team is generated. The selection can have any sorted data of the individual or a whole group, a pre defined format of the report is used and an output file is been generated for the same.
    <center><h4>Chat</h4></center>
    To keep easy communication between all the team members a chatting module is included, with this we can chat with the team members. A simplified protocol is used for the chatting purpose for better utilization of the hardware and network factors. In addition to this, easy calling and mailing to the team members is also provided on the fly. An attempt is made to keep this communication module very secure and fast, with minimum amount of resource usage.
